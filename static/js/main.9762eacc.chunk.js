While a student, I was asked by the staff to tutor every software course offered at IWCC. For my hard work, I was awarded the Kirlin Gold Award, which is the highest award given to IT students at IWCC.

While on OSS I was able to build strong ties to every other department within the company. Although I didn't have the strongest development skills at the time, I used what I knew to automate many of my day-to-day tasks. I even created a mock website for our sales team for an upcoming demo to a potential new client.

Along with learning all I can, I have also developed a love for sharing that knowledge on to others. I have worked with our QA team to move them from mostly manual testing to understanding and developing the skills necessary to write automated testing using software like Selenium.
