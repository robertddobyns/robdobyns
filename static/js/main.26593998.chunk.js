I even created a mock website for our sales team for an upcoming demo to a potential new client.

Along with learning all I can, I have also developed a love for sharing that knowledge on to others. I have worked with our QA team to move them from mostly manual testing to understanding and developing the skills necessary to write automated testing using software like Selenium.
