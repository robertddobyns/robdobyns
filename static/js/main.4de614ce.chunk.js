While a student, I was asked by the staff to tutor every software course offered at IWCC. For my hard work, I was awarded the Kirlin Gold Award, which is the highest award given to IT students at IWCC.

After about a year, I was offered a full time position by the CTO and the opportunity to create and lead their Tier 2 / Tier 3 support team, which I named Operational Support Services. While on OSS I was able to build strong ties to every other department within the company. Although I didn't have the strongest development skills at the time, I used what I knew to automate many of my day-to-day tasks. I even created a mock website for our sales team for an upcoming demo to a potential new client.

I've created several personal sites in an attempt to better understand Spring, React, software architecture and more. I love learning and this is finally a career where I can never learn it all. Along with learning all I can, I have also developed a love for sharing that knowledge on to others. I have worked with our QA team to move them from mostly manual testing to understanding and developing the skills necessary to write automated testing using software like Selenium.
